# 🔥 Breaking News Generator

A fun and random Breaking News Generator built with **Flask**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This mini-project randomly creates hilarious or surprising news headlines featuring celebrities, actions, and places.

## 🚀 Features

- Randomly generated breaking news headlines
- Interactive frontend with a "Generate News" button
- Smooth communication between frontend and backend using Flask + JSON
- Clean and responsive UI using HTML/CSS

## 🧠 How It Works

- On the frontend, a button triggers a POST request to the backend.
- The Flask backend randomly selects:
  - A subject (e.g., "MODI JI", "ELON MUSK")
  - An action (e.g., "EATING", "BUYING TWITTER")
  - A place (e.g., "AT RED FORT", "IN SPACE")
- A fake but funny **BREAKING NEWS** headline is generated and returned.
